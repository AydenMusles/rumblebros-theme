# Rumblebros Shopify Theme
This is the custom District theme for our Shopify store rumblebrothers.com
## I've implemented a few custom features into this theme.
1. Vehicle picker
    - Pulls years, makes, models from assets/models.json
    - Shows selection option right under main navigation
    - If a vehilce is selected, it will refresh any shopify collection that is related to car parts to match the current vehicle selected
    - Each producted is tagged with appropriate year_, make_, model_, and trim_ tags as that's how Shopify sorts collections
    - Confirms vehicle fitment on the product's page
